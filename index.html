    <p>alem de um lorem ipsum, agora esse arquivo tambem tem a letra de drum show

        Puttin' on a drum show
        Ooh-ooh

        Completed checklist for today
        Now they have to let you out of your cage
        Feelin' stuck between a rock and a home
        Two places you do not want to go
        So, so

        He's puttin' on a drum show
        Even now, even now, even now
        He'll take the longer way home
        Even now, even now, even now
        He'll never ever say so
        He drives fast just to feel it, feel it (feel it)
        He drives slow if his song's not over (feel it)
        Drown it out, drown it out

        Show
        Ooh-ooh

        He'd rather feel something than nothing at all
        So he swerves all around as his head starts to fall, turns it up
        Stuck between a rock and a home
        Two places he does not wanna go
        So, so

        He's puttin' on a drum show
        Even now, even now, even now
        He'll take the longer way home (I've been this way)
        Even now, even now, even now (I want to change)
        He'll never ever say so
        He drives fast just to feel it, feel it (feel it)
        He drives slow if his song's not over (feel it)
        Drown it out, drown it out (I want to)

        I've been this way
        I want to change
        I've been this way
        I want to change

        He's puttin' on a drum show
        Even now, even now, even now
        He'll take the longer way home (I've been this way)
        Even now, even now, even now (I want to change)
        He'll never ever say so
        He drives fast just to feel it, feel it (feel it)
        He drives slow if his song's not over (feel it)
        Drown it out, drown it out (I want to go)

        I've been this way
        I want to change (feel it)
        I've been this way (feel it)
        I want to

    <p>alem da letra de drum show, agora tem a letra de the contract

        I check the doors, check the windows and pull the blinds
        I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time
        I have a feeling that necromancer's outside
        And I'm just tryin' to stay quiet

        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, promises and contracts
        I used to keep
        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, my hallucination
        I used to see

        Wake up and I find out, did a change up
        Wait, did it change up? Is it light out yet? Better find out, bet
        I'ma walk around the edge of the room and the bed where I hide my face
        Pace around, better try to breathe
        Pace around, pace around

        I check the doors, check the windows and pull the blinds
        I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time
        I have a feeling that necromancer's outside
        And I'm just tryin' to stay quiet

        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, promises and contracts
        I used to keep
        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, my hallucination
        I used to see
        I used to see

        Sleep (sleep), I (I) found

        (Ooh-ooh) I wanna get out there
        (Ooh-ooh) but I don't try
        (Ooh-ooh) I wanna get out there
        (Ooh-ooh) but I don't try

        I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time
        I have a feeling that necromancer's outside
        And I'm just tryin' to stay quiet

        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, promises and contracts
        I used to keep
        (I don't sleep much) that's crazy, how'd you know that?
        (Keep myself up) that's maybe how you know that
        Ooh, my hallucination
        I used to see

        I used to see
        I used to see
        Ooh, my hallucination
        I used to see

        I used to see
        It felt so real
        But now I plead
        Just take the deal
        I promised you
        A contract
        I promised you
        A contract
    </p>
